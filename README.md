Design:
- Decide to use basic css for styling. More complex app would use sass.
- Decide not to use date time library such as moment.js. So the package size can be small.
- Create a loader through pure CSS animation, rather than using a image. So the package size can be small.
- Use Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout. But if the app required IE support, it should only use Flexbox
- Use lib such as boostrap 5 for consistently look and feel. Normally all the theming, global style should set up in sass.
